I"<<p>やあ！ As mentioned on my home page, I am Bruno, a half Dutch half Welsh computer scientist student. I am a firm beliver in open source and data privacy, which often go hand-in-hand.</p>

<p>I am currently studying for a BEng in computer science at the University of York, on track to earn a First (1st) Class Honours degree.</p>

<p>My favourite way to end a long day is with a Judo (or 柔道 in Japanese). It clears my head and gives me the oppertunity to focus purely on whats happening on the mat. I am currently a Blue belt, with no plans on slowing down! I have competed in the British University Championships in 2019 and achieved a bronze medel in my weight category.</p>
