> 9/10 - An amazing story, world, and characters but at times has flat writing. 

**Some Spoilers** :) 

*TL:DR*: I loved this book. It is a classic zero-to-hero tale with a pop-culture twist, which is a combo I am a sucker for. The writing can get flat at points, especially when describing (in detail) specific references. Most of the time Cline (author) made these obscure references exciting since he probably loved them himself. While the book did not have a profound message, which I **do not** think books need to have, it provides immense entertainment.

### Storyline
As it might be clear from the *TL;DR*, I love a good story where the main character starts out a loser, and through various challenges, becomes the hero their world needs. While tacky it is a classic for a reason ~ people love it. 

The first half of the book is at a slightly slower pace than the second half, but it does not feel sluggish. This is because Cline has great character building scenes mixed in with the main storyline. By the end of the first half you feel like you know the main three; Parzival, Aech, and Art3mis. This setup is perfect for when the book starts to really pick up

The second half is just so well written I read it all in one night. The story just *explodes* and the characters grow, fail, and overcome. I can't spoil too much but if you read the book, this is where I think the fun is. 

My one gripe with the storyline is the ending. While it was very sweet to end on Wade and Samantha finally meeting and kissing, I wanted more in Oasis. Even a small "wrap" up chapter would have been nice with a bit of what Wade decided to do with Oasis, what he used his money and powers for, and what happened to Sorrento. However, the open endedness of the book did leave space for the second book to be written which I am happy about.

### World 
Wow, the world in Ready Player One feels both fictional and also *very very* real. Energy crisis? <i class="fas fa-check"></i> Global disasters of the disease, nature, and more kind? <i class="fas fa-check"></i> Global monopolies that control vital resources? <i class="fas fa-check-double"></i> 

Alongside these dilemmas are massive leaps in technology, many of which I hope for in our reality. I think the thing I want most to be true are the capabilities of AR and OASIS. I already think 'AR Chat' is a great game, but if it had all the features in OASIS, it would be ***amazing***. 

### Characters 
* **Parzival / Wade Watts**: I think how much I was able to relate to Wade was the reason he was such a special character for me. I'll leave it at that. 

* **Aech / (Too big of a spoiler)**: A classic best friend. Their back and forth is even fun to read and instantly reminds you of arguing with your best friend. I think the fight between them was really realistic and I wish Cline put more time into them making up. Also, omg that twist! So much fun! 

* **Art3mis / Samantha**: A strong female, but still a support character and the love interest... It was clear that her and Parzival were similar level gunters, I would argue she would be better. I think it is a shame she ended up taking the backseat more towards the end of the book and became more of a love interest. In terms of other books with a similar dynamic, she is definitely more unique, stronger, and not as much of a side character. Just would have been better if Cline showed that more. 

### Overall
A super fun book! Like I have stated before I think people criticizing a book for not having a powerful message is annoying. Personally, these kinds of books are entertaining and I judge them off that. This book was massively entertaining and introduces new ideas that I would never have thought of. 

For that I will give this book a 9/10.

Time to watch the movie, which I've heard is *not* very true to the book...
